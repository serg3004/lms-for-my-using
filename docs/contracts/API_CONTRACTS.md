# API Contracts

> **Статус:** `CURRENT` human semantics / invariants.
>
> **API surface authority:** runtime OpenAPI + controllers. This file is not a complete route inventory.

## Current API authority

- Base path: `/api/v1`.
- Runtime OpenAPI JSON: `/api/v1/api-json`.
- Swagger UI: `/api/v1/docs`.
- Legacy `/api/v1/openapi` is deprecated and is not current authority.
- Generated API navigation: [`../generated/API_INDEX.md`](../generated/API_INDEX.md).

For a concrete endpoint, verify current runtime OpenAPI/controller metadata. Do not add a manually maintained route list here.

## Authentication/session semantics

- Access tokens are JWTs and may be supplied through supported cookie/bearer flows.
- Refresh tokens are backed by server-side session state and rotate.
- Logout revokes the current session; logout-all revokes all sessions for the current user.
- Password-reset request/confirm is implemented; delivery-provider availability is a separate live/config concern.

Historical descriptions of stateless-only logout or an intentional password-reset `503` do not override current auth code.

## Tenant and authorization semantics

- Authenticated requests operate within current organization context.
- Role policies are owned by `apps/api/src/modules/auth/roles.ts`; object-level guards/access policies provide additional enforcement.
- The current role set is owned by Prisma/shared role definitions, not this document.
- Human RBAC semantics: [`API_RBAC_MATRIX.md`](./API_RBAC_MATRIX.md).
- Generated current policy view: [`../generated/RBAC.md`](../generated/RBAC.md).

## Error contract

Canonical API errors use the shared runtime response/error layer. Current stable code/types are authoritative for fields and codes.

Representative shape:

```json
{
  "statusCode": 400,
  "error": {
    "code": "VALIDATION_ERROR",
    "message": "Validation failed"
  },
  "path": "/api/v1/example",
  "timestamp": "2026-01-01T00:00:00.000Z"
}
```

Do not document additional fields as guaranteed unless the current shared/runtime contract contains them.

## List-query evolution

Pagination/filter/sort behavior is endpoint-specific until code proves a shared runtime response contract. Existing response shapes must not change silently.

When changing a list endpoint:

- use runtime validation;
- keep queries organization-scoped;
- allowlist sortable/filterable fields;
- update backend tests, runtime OpenAPI and affected frontend client in the same PR;
- update this document only for human semantics/invariants.

Adding an optional query filter (e.g. a `search` term) to an existing paginated list
endpoint's own allowlisted fields is not itself a human-semantics/invariant change and
does not require an edit here, as long as authorization/tenant-scoping is unchanged.
Runtime OpenAPI and [`../generated/API_INDEX.md`](../generated/API_INDEX.md) remain the
route-shape authority.

## Organization structure import and history

An organization-structure CSV preview never mutates domain data. A successful preview stores
the exact normalized validated payload server-side and returns a random opaque token whose
SHA-256 digest, tenant, actor, kind, mode, 30-minute expiry, and consumption state are persisted.
Commit applies only that snapshot in a Serializable transaction, revalidates it against current
state, and atomically claims the token. Tokens are single-use and cannot cross actors or tenants.
Neither raw CSV nor the token is written to organization-structure events.

Archiving a Department is non-destructive and is rejected while it has active children, current
memberships, current local managers, or active Department assignments. Archiving a Position is
rejected while a current membership or active PositionCourse uses it. Restore does not reactivate
relations or learning targets.

## Product scope vs implementation

Implementation existence does not determine MVP disposition. Product boundaries live in [`../product/MVP_SCOPE_LOCK.md`](../product/MVP_SCOPE_LOCK.md); unresolved owner/business decisions live in [`../status/OPEN_DECISIONS.md`](../status/OPEN_DECISIONS.md).

Do not use retired mixed trackers as a current source for implementation or scope.

## Live/deployment statements

Production provider/deployment/protection state is live evidence, not API contract. Dated evidence explains what was observed at a specific time/SHA/environment and must not be promoted to permanent current truth.

## Contract change rules

- Public path/request/response changes require runtime OpenAPI/tests/client/docs review in the same logical PR.
- New request bodies use the repository's current runtime validation approach.
- Database-backed contract changes follow Prisma/migration compatibility rules.
- Authorization changes update policy/guard tests and human RBAC semantics.
- Never manually copy the complete runtime route surface into this file.
